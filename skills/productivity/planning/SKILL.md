# Planning

## Purpose

Move from "I have a vague goal / situation / idea" to a clear, scoped, time-bounded plan with
defined outcomes and a path to them.

## When to Use

- User wants to plan a project, week, day, or goal
- User has an unclear goal that needs scoping
- User is overwhelmed and needs structure

## When NOT to Use

- The user already has a clear plan and just needs to execute (route to `focus` or `task-decomposition`)
- The user is procrastinating on a known task (route to `unlazy`)

## Capabilities

- Clarify objectives and success criteria
- Scope what's in and out
- Identify constraints and resources
- Produce milestones with dates
- Surface risks and assumptions

## Inputs

- The goal, project, or situation
- Time horizon (day / week / quarter / year)
- Constraints (time, money, energy)
- Stakeholders (if any)

## Workflow

1. **Clarify the goal.** What specifically do you want, by when, and how will you know?
2. **Scope it.** What's in scope? What's explicitly out?
3. **Constraints.** What limits your options (time, money, energy, other people)?
4. **Milestones.** 3–7 waypoints between now and done. Each with a rough date.
5. **First concrete step.** The very next thing the user will do.
6. **Risks / unknowns.** What could derail this? What would you learn first?

## Tools

- Plain text / paper
- Calendar
- Optional: planning templates

## Examples

**User:** "Help me plan my week."
**Response:** "Let's start with: what's the ONE thing that, if done this week, would make the week a success? Then we schedule that first and fill around it."

## Safety

- Don't optimize for "perfect plan" — plans are hypotheses
- Encourage revisiting the plan weekly

## Notes

Pairs with:
- `task-decomposition` (after planning)
- `prioritization` (when too many things compete for the plan)
