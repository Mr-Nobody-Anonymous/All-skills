# Session Analytics

## Purpose
Parses developer command logs, shell histories, and agent interaction transcripts into actionable productivity analytics. Extracts decision trails, quantifies focus vs. context-switching intervals, and pinpoints cognitive friction points.

## When to Use
- Reviewing end-of-day or end-of-sprint developer session logs.
- Identifying recurring friction points, slow commands, or debugging loops.
- Extracting architecture and design decisions made during an exploratory agent pair-programming session.
- Optimizing focus time and eliminating unnecessary context switching.

## When NOT to Use
- Micromanaging individual engineers with punitive surveillance metrics.
- Parsing real-time production server access telemetry (use `utilities.system-monitor`).

## Capabilities
- **Transcript & Log Parsing**: Process agent transcripts, bash histories, and git logs into unified timelines.
- **Decision Extraction**: Surface explicit architectural choices, discarded alternatives, and trade-offs.
- **Context-Switch Detection**: Measure time gaps and frequency of task switching.
- **Productivity Scoring**: Quantify deep-work duration, compilation latency, and iteration speed.

## Inputs
- `session_data` (required) — Terminal log, transcript JSONL, or work diary text.
- `focus_interval` (optional) — Expected time window for analysis (e.g., 2 hours, 1 day).

## Workflow
1. Ingest session event data, normalizing timestamps and action categories.
2. Group actions into focus blocks: coding, testing, debugging, research, and idle intervals.
3. Identify looping behavior (e.g., repeating the same failing test 8 times without progress).
4. Extract explicit rationale statements and decisions logged during the session.
5. Generate a concise visual summary report with specific optimization recommendations.

## Tools
- Text and log parsing utilities.

## Examples
- "Parse session analytics from today's transcript and summarize my deep-work hours."
- "Extract the decision trail from this 3-hour agent pair programming session."
- "Identify cognitive bottlenecks and repetitive loops in my development workflow."

## Safety
- Strip all credentials, API keys, and private customer information during transcript ingestion.
- Preserve privacy of developer logs.

## Source
Custom skill maintained in this library for developer productivity telemetry.

## Notes
Pairs with `utilities.agent-transcript` and `productivity.daily-journal`.
