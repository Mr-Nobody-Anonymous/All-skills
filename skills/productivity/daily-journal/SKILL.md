# Daily Journal

## Purpose
Run a short, structured **daily check-in** that helps the user notice what mattered,
what worked, and what to carry into tomorrow. The skill is intentionally lightweight:
three prompts in, three blocks out, no scoring, no streak pressure.

## When to Use
- The user wants a morning intention prompt
- The user wants an evening wrap-up
- The user wants to start journaling but has no template

## When NOT to Use
- The user is in acute distress (route to support)
- The user wants long-form memoir writing (different skill)

## Capabilities
- Three-mode operation: `morning`, `midday`, `evening`
- Prompts that are open enough to feel easy, specific enough to be useful
- A template that survives a 90-second answer
- Optional append to a vault (see `obsidian-sync`)
- Track wins (â‰¤ 3), friction (â‰¤ 3), one lesson, one intention

## Inputs
- `mode` (morning | midday | evening)
- Optional `append_to` (path to a daily-note file or vault)
- Optional `template` (custom prompts; default is shipped)

## Workflow
1. Parse inputs and verify environment prerequisites.
2. Execute bounded operations with continuous validation.
3. Return verified results and logs.

## Tools
- None required
- Optional: filesystem append, `obsidian-sync`

## Examples
**User:** "Start my morning journal."
**Response:** "1. Intention? 2. Win for today? 3. What will you protect?"

**User:** "Wrap up today."
**Response:** "Wins? Friction? Lesson? Intention for tomorrow?" — and writes a
markdown file `daily/2026-02-09.md`.

## Safety
- Never log mood/energy to a third party
- Honor a "private" flag (no write, output only to chat)
- Do not pressure the user to write long answers
- If distress appears, suggest a break and a support contact
