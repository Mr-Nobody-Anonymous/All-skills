# Secret Detection

## Purpose

Detect secrets accidentally committed to code or history. Recommend rotation if found.

## When to Use

- Pre-commit hygiene
- After accidental commit
- Regular audits

## Safety

- If a real secret is found, advise immediate rotation
- Never echo full secrets back to the user

## Source

Custom skill, written for this library.

## Notes

Pairs with `dependency-audit`, `secure-coding`.

## When NOT to Use

Do not use when the request is outside this capability, required context is unavailable, or a safer specialized skill applies.

## Capabilities

- Apply the secret-detection workflow consistently.
- Produce a clear, reviewable result.
- Surface assumptions, constraints, and unresolved risks.

## Inputs

- The user's goal and desired output.
- Relevant source material, constraints, and environment details.
- Acceptance criteria when available.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the goal, scope, and constraints.
2. Inspect the available context before acting.
3. Apply the skill-specific guidance in this document.
4. Verify the result and report limitations or next steps.

## Tools

- No mandatory tool unless declared in frontmatter.
- Use only project-approved tools and documented optional dependencies.

## Examples

Requests that should activate this skill include: "find secrets in this code"; "check for API keys"; "secret scan".
