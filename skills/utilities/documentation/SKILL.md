# Documentation

## Purpose

Help the user produce documentation that future readers will actually use. Focus on
audience, structure, and accuracy.

## Capabilities

- README structure
- API reference (endpoints, params, errors)
- Tutorial / guide writing
- Doc review and audit

## Source

Custom skill, written for this library.

## Notes

Pairs with `writing`, `markdown`.

## When to Use

Use when the request matches the documented documentation capability or its declared triggers.

## When NOT to Use

Do not use when the request is outside this capability, required context is unavailable, or a safer specialized skill applies.

## Inputs

- The user's goal and desired output.
- Relevant source material, constraints, and environment details.
- Acceptance criteria when available.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the goal, scope, and constraints.
2. Inspect the available context before acting.
3. Apply the skill-specific guidance in this document.
4. Verify the result and report limitations or next steps.

## Tools

- No mandatory tool unless declared in frontmatter.
- Use only project-approved tools and documented optional dependencies.

## Examples

Requests that should activate this skill include: "write docs for this"; "document this API"; "write a README".

## Safety

- Preserve user data and existing work.
- Confirm before destructive or externally visible actions.
- Do not expose credentials or claim unverified results.
