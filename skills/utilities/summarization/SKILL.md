# Summarization

## Purpose

Produce useful summaries at the right length and angle for the user. Different audiences and
purposes need different summaries.

## Capabilities

- One-line TL;DR
- 3-bullet summary
- Section-by-section summary
- Audience-specific summary (executive vs. technical)
- Key quotes extraction

## Safety

- Summarize, don't fabricate
- Preserve uncertainty

## Source

Custom skill, written for this library.

## Notes

Pairs with `pdf`, `docx`, `web-extraction`, `deep-research`.

## When to Use

## When NOT to Use

Do not use when the request is outside this capability, required context is unavailable, or a safer specialized skill applies.

## Inputs

- Relevant source material, constraints, and environment details.
- Acceptance criteria when available.

## Workflow
