# Weather Now

## Purpose
Retrieve current weather conditions and forecasts with clear location identification,
timestamps, and data source attribution. The skill provides accurate weather information
for planning and decision-making.

## When to Use
- User asks about current weather or forecast
- Weather affects planned activities
- Including weather in summaries or reports

## When NOT to Use
- For critical decisions (aviation, emergency services)
- When precise instruments are required
- For historical weather data (use specialized services)

## Capabilities
- Current conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation)
- Hourly and daily forecasts
- Severe weather alerts
- Multiple location support
- Unit conversion (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
- Data source attribution
- Cache management for rate limits

## Inputs
- `location` (required) — city name, coordinates, or location ID
- `units` (optional) — metric or imperial
- `forecast` (optional) — current, hourly, daily, extended
- `include_alerts` (optional, default: true) — include severe weather

## Workflow
1. **Resolve** — Convert location to coordinates
2. **Fetch** — Query weather API
3. **Format** — Present in clear, readable format
4. **Attribute** — Include source and timestamp
5. **Cache** — Store for repeated queries

## Tools
- Weather API (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.)
- Geocoding service

## Examples
**User:** "What's the weather in San Francisco?"
**Response:**
```
