# Academic Research

## Purpose

Locate and use scholarly sources for a research question. Distinguish peer-reviewed work
from preprints, popularizations, and predatory journals.

## When to Use

- User wants scholarly evidence
- User is writing a literature review
- The question benefits from primary research

## When NOT to Use

- The user wants a quick answer (route to `web-research`)

## Capabilities

- Query academic databases (arXiv, PubMed, Google Scholar, etc.)
- Identify peer-reviewed vs. preprint vs. predatory
- Extract methods, findings, and limitations
- Compose literature-review prose

## Safety

- Don't conflate preprints with peer-reviewed work
- Flag predatory / low-quality journals
- Note study limitations

## Source

Custom skill, written for this library.
