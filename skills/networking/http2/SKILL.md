# HTTP/2 Multiplexing & Stream Architecture

## Purpose

Optimize HTTP/2 binary framing, single-connection stream multiplexing, header compression (HPACK), and server push.

This canonical skill provides deterministic, production-grade operational directives for AI agents executing autonomous engineering and verification tasks within the `networking` domain.

## When to Use

- When designing, developing, optimizing, or debugging within `networking` tasks.
- When an autonomous agent requires deterministic execution patterns for `http2`.
- When verifying compliance, architecture, or performance standards in this domain.

## When NOT to Use

- When operating outside the scope of `networking` engineering.
- When a more specialized sub-skill or external toolchain is explicitly requested by the user.

## Capabilities

- Structural design and implementation for HTTP/2 Multiplexing & Stream Architecture.
- Automated verification, schema compliance, and diagnostic troubleshooting.
- Performance profiling, security posture hardening, and error recovery.

## Inputs

- Project source files, configuration manifests, or task instructions.
- Target runtime environment parameters and toolchain dependencies.

## Workflow

1. **Pre-flight Assessment**: Inspect existing configuration and environment preconditions.
2. **Implementation & Transformation**: Apply focused, AST-aware structural modifications.
3. **Verification & Audit**: Execute domain-specific test suites, syntax checks, or simulation passes.
4. **Resolution**: Resolve any detected regressions or failure modes prior to completion.

## Tools

- Project-approved terminal tools, file editors, and verification test harnesses.

## Examples

- Standard operational execution pattern for `http2`:
  ```bash
  # Verify environment readiness and execute task workflow
  allskills route "http2"
  ```

## Safety

- Maintain strict workspace boundary sandboxing.
- Prevent unvetted credential exposure and destructive disk operations.
- Ensure all modifications are verified before concluding execution.

## Source

All-Skills Canonical Engineering Framework.

## Notes

- Pairs with relevant testing, linting, and architecture verification skills across the platform.
