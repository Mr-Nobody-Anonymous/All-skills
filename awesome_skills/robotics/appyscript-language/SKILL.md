# AppyScript Language — Expert Reference

AppyScript (github.com/rahulbachina/appyscript, MIT, invented by Applaa) is an
English-first programming language for educational robotics. Kids write code that
reads like a story; the compiler emits MicroPython (ESP32/Pico/micro:bit),
Arduino C++, or CircuitPython. Blocks close with `end` — no braces, no semicolons,
no indentation rules. Case-insensitive keywords. `#` starts a comment.

**Prime directive for agents:** every program you produce MUST pass
`npx appyscript validate file.appy` (or the `appyscript_validate` MCP tool)
before you show it to anyone. The grammar below is verified against the real
compiler (`validate()` from the npm package), not against the README — they
differ, and the differences are listed explicitly in the "FAILS validation"
section. Keep programs under 40 lines.

---

## 1. Program structure

A program is a sequence of **top-level blocks** only. Exactly three kinds:

```appyscript
when <trigger>        # event handler ('on' is a synonym for 'when')
  <statements>
end

forever               # top-level background loop (NOT a statement)
  <statements>
end

define <name>         # custom behaviour, called with 'do <name>'
  <statements>
end
```

Anything else at top level is error E010. This includes `let` (must live inside
a block, conventionally `when start`), `every 10s` (must be written
`when every 10s`), and bare statements.

Block-nesting rules that trip everyone:

| Construct | Top level? | Inside a block? |
|---|---|---|
| `when <trigger>` | YES | no |
| `forever` | YES | **NO — "Unknown statement: forever"** |
| `define <name>` | YES | no |
| `if / else`, `repeat N times`, `while` | no | YES |
| `let / set / change / remember` | **NO** | YES |

To loop forever *as the whole program*, use a top-level `forever` block, or
`when start` containing a `while <always-true-comparison>` loop. There is no
`forever` statement inside a handler — rewrite as `while` with a sensor or
variable condition.

---

## 2. Triggers (verified)

```appyscript
when start                      # runs once at boot ('when starts' also works)
when button_a pressed           # 'released' also accepted; bare 'when button_a' works
when button_b pressed
when shaken
when tilted                     # optional direction: when tilted left / right
when every 5s                   # timer; 'when timer 5s' is a synonym
when received                   # radio message arrived ('receives' synonym)
when distance < 30cm            # sensor threshold trigger
when light < 20%
when temperature > 30           # number only — NO unit suffix on temperature
when touch > 0
when acceleration > 2           # esp32 + microbit + circuitpython only
```

Sensor trigger form: `when <sensor> <op> <number><unit?>`.
Operators: `<  >  <=  >=  =  ==` (both `=` and `==` mean equals; `is` is NOT valid).
Units: `cm` for distance, `%` for light/speed, none for temperature/touch/acceleration.
`when temperature > 30c` FAILS — drop the unit.

Sensor triggers compile to a polling loop (every 50 ms on async targets), so
they re-fire while the condition stays true. Use a variable flag if you need
edge-triggered (fire-once) behaviour.

---

## 3. Statements (verified)

### Movement
```appyscript
move forward at 50% for 2s      # speed and duration both optional
move backward at 40% for 300ms  # 'back' = 'backward'
move left at 50% for 300ms      # strafe/curve left (kit-dependent)
move forward at full            # word speeds: full / half / slow / fast (bare word, see gotcha)
move forward                    # defaults: continues until 'stop'
back at 60% for 1s              # 'back' alone as the verb also works
stop
turn left 90°                   # turn = pivot; degree SYMBOL required (see gotcha)
turn right 45°
spin right 360°                 # spin = fast in-place rotation
spin left 90                    # bare number also accepted (degrees implied)
```

**Gotchas:**
- `at full speed` FAILS ("Unknown statement: speed") — write `at full` or `at 100%`.
- `turn left 90 degrees` FAILS — use the `°` symbol or a bare number.
- A `move` without `for <duration>` runs until `stop` — always pair them or the
  robot drives away.

### Output
```appyscript
say "Hello!"                    # TTS / serial print. STRING LITERAL ONLY.
show happy                      # facial expression (see list below)
show text "GO!"                 # text on display. STRING LITERAL ONLY.
play "success"                  # named sound; any string accepted, kit maps it
```

**Hard limitation (verified):** `say` and `show text` accept ONLY a quoted
string. `say score`, `say "Score: " + score`, and `show number n` ALL FAIL
validation. There is currently no way to speak or display a variable's value.
Design around it: use expressions/sounds as feedback (`show excited` when
score is high), or fixed strings per branch:

```appyscript
if score > 4
  say "Amazing score!"
else
  say "Good try!"
end
```

### Expressions (the robot's face)
`happy` · `sad` · `thinking` · `excited` · `angry` · `alert` · `sleep` · `calm` · `confused` · `dizzy`

Exactly these ten. `show love`, `show surprised`, etc. fail. Pick the nearest.

### Timing
```appyscript
wait 500ms
wait 2s
wait 500                        # bare number = milliseconds
```

### Variables
```appyscript
let score = 0                   # declare (inside a block only, usually 'when start')
set score to score + 1          # assign; right side may use + - * / and other vars
set score to score * 2
change score by 1               # increment shorthand (negative: change score by 0 - 1)
remember score                  # persist to device flash/NVS across power cycles
let ok = yes                    # booleans: yes/no/true/false are literals...
```

- Variables declared with `let` inside `when start` are emitted at global scope
  and are visible in every other handler — this is the standard pattern for
  shared state (flags, counters).
- Using a variable never declared with `let` produces warning E021 (still
  compiles, becomes 0). Always `let` first in `when start`.
- **Negative literals FAIL**: `let n = -1` is a parse error. Use `let n = 0`
  then `change n by 0 - 1`, or restructure to count up.
- **Bare booleans cannot be conditions**: `if ok` FAILS — conditions must be
  comparisons. Use numeric flags: `let ringing = 0` ... `if ringing > 0`.

### Control flow
```appyscript
if distance < 20cm              # optional 'then' after the condition
  show alert
else                            # 'otherwise' is a synonym for 'else'
  show calm
end

if distance < 10cm
  show angry
else
  if distance < 25cm            # else-if = nested if inside else (no 'elif')
    show alert
  else
    show calm
  end
end

repeat 3 times
  spin right 90°
  wait 500ms
end

while distance > 50cm           # condition must be a comparison
  move forward at 30%
  wait 10ms                     # ALWAYS wait inside while/forever (W001/W006)
end
```

Conditions combine with `and` / `or` / `not`:
```appyscript
if distance < 20cm and light < 50%
  show alert
end
if not distance < 10cm
  show calm
end
```

### Custom behaviours
```appyscript
define celebrate                # NO parameters — 'define wave(times)' is invalid
  show excited
  say "Yay!"
  spin right 360°
end

when button_a pressed
  do celebrate                  # E020 if the name was never defined
end
```

Defines may call other defines (`do` chains work). Duplicate names = E022.
An unused define = warning W004.

### Radio (paired robots)
```appyscript
send "hello"                    # broadcast a message
when received                   # fires when any message arrives
  say "Got a message!"
end
```
Only on targets with `hasRadio` (esp32, pico, microbit, circuitpython — NOT arduino).

## 4. FAILS validation today (despite appearing in docs/examples)

The repo's own README and some bundled examples use constructs the shipped
compiler rejects. **Never emit these** — they are roadmap, not language:

| Construct | Error | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| `let x = pick random 1 to 6` | E010 "Unknown statement: random" | Derive pseudo-variety from sensor reads (`if light < 50%`) or alternate with a counter flag |
| `let l = list` / `add "x" to l` / `item n of l` | E010 | Use separate if-branches with fixed strings |
| `say "Score: " + score` (string concat) | E010 "+" | Fixed strings per branch |
| `say score` (variable) | "Expected STRING" | Same |
| `show number n` | parse error | Same |
| `every 10s` as a top-level block | "Expected when/forever/define" | `when every 10s` |
| `forever` inside a handler | E010 | Top-level `forever` block, or `while` loop |
| `let` at top level | "Expected when/forever/define" | Move into `when start` |
| `define name(param)` | parse error | No params; make one define per variant |
| `match x / case 1 / default` | E010 | Nested if/else (match exists in lexer only) |
| `repeat until <cond>` | parse error | `while <inverted cond>` |
| `at full speed` | E010 "speed" | `at full` or `at 100%` |
| `turn left 90 degrees` | E010 "degrees" | `turn left 90°` or `spin left 90` |
| `let n = -1` | parse error | `let n = 0` + `change n by 0 - 1` |
| `if flag` (bare variable) | "Expected comparison operator" | `if flag > 0` |
| `if n is 1` | "Expected comparison operator" | `if n = 1` |
| `when temperature > 30c` | E010 "c" | No unit on temperature |
| `when touch pressed` | parse error | `when touch > 0` |

---

## 5. Hardware targets (verified profiles)

| Target ID | Hardware | Runtime | distance | light | temp | touch | accel | Display | Radio | Async | Flash/RAM |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `esp32` | ESP32 / M5Stack Core S3 SE | MicroPython | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | 8 MB / 512 KB |
| `arduino` | Uno / Nano / Mega | C++ | Y | Y | Y | Y | **N** | **N** | **N** | N | 32 KB / 2 KB |
| `pico` | Raspberry Pi Pico W | MicroPython | Y | Y | Y | Y | **N** | **N** | Y | Y | 2 MB / 264 KB |
| `microbit` | BBC micro:bit V2 | MicroPython | **N** | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y (5x5) | Y | N | — |
| `circuitpython` | Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit | CircuitPython | **N** | Y | Y | Y | Y | N | Y | — | — |

Semantic check E023 hard-fails the compile when a sensor isn't on the target:
- `when distance < 30cm` compiles on esp32/arduino/pico, FAILS on microbit and
  circuitpython (no ultrasonic). Use `light`/`acceleration` plots there.
- `when acceleration > 2` and `when shaken` need an IMU — not on arduino/pico
  profiles (`shaken` still parses everywhere; pick esp32/microbit for shake games).
- `show text` needs a display — only esp32 and microbit have one. On other
  targets it degrades to serial print; don't build UX around it.
- `send`/`when received` need radio — not arduino.

When the user hasn't named a chip, default to `esp32` (everything available),
and say so. If the program uses `distance`, never offer microbit/circuitpython.

---

## 6. What the compiler generates (so you can debug flashes)

**esp32 / pico (MicroPython, async):** each `when` becomes an
`async def _handler_*()` task; sensor triggers poll every 50 ms; top-level
`forever` becomes its own task; all gathered under `uasyncio`. Generated code
imports `from applaa_robot import Robot, wait_ms` — the **applaa_robot runtime
library must already be on the board's filesystem** or you get
`ImportError: no module named 'applaa_robot'` at boot. `wait` →
`await asyncio.sleep_ms(n)` (never `time.sleep` — would block all handlers).

**arduino (C++, polling):** single `loop()`; every trigger becomes an `if` check
per iteration; `wait` → `delay(ms)` (blocking — a 3 s wait in one handler stalls
button detection; keep waits short on arduino). Includes `<AppyRobot.h>` — the
AppyRobot Arduino library must be installed in the IDE. `say` → `Serial.println`
+ beep at 115200 baud. Variables from `let` are hoisted to globals above `setup()`.

**microbit:** MicroPython polling loop (no uasyncio on micro:bit V2 MicroPython).
**circuitpython:** CircuitPython idioms for Circuit Playground Bluefruit.

Practical consequences:
- On arduino, `when every 5s` is implemented with millis bookkeeping inside
  `loop()`; long `delay()` calls from other handlers skew the interval.
- Sensor `when` blocks re-enter while true. A robot inside `when distance < 30cm`
  that takes 2 s of actions will immediately re-run if the obstacle is still
  there — intended for alarms, surprising for one-shot greetings. Gate with a flag:

```appyscript
when start
  let greeted = 0
end

when distance < 30cm
  if greeted = 0
    set greeted to 1
    say "Hello there!"
    show happy
  end
end

when distance > 60cm
  set greeted to 0
end
```

## 7. Validation workflow for agents (mandatory)

Via MCP (preferred — the server ships in the package, tools:
`appyscript_validate`, `appyscript_compile`, `appyscript_simulate`,
`appyscript_explain`, `appyscript_hardware_info`, `appyscript_list_targets`,
`appyscript_list_keywords`):

1. Draft the program (< 40 lines, comment header with title + what it teaches).
2. `appyscript_validate` → fix every error, then every warning.
3. `appyscript_compile` with the actual target → catches E023 sensor mismatches
   that pure validation can miss for the chosen chip.
4. `appyscript_simulate` with injected sensors to confirm behaviour:
   `{ sensors: { distance: 20 }, buttons: { a: true }, triggerEvents: ["shaken"], maxTicks: 50 }`.

Via CLI:
```bash
npx appyscript validate robot.appy
npx appyscript compile robot.appy --target esp32 --strict   # warnings = errors
npx appyscript simulate robot.appy --sensor-distance=20 --button-a --max-ticks=100
npx appyscript explain robot.appy        # plain-English summary, good for kid-facing output
```

Diagnostic codes you will see:

| Code | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| E010 | Unknown statement / unexpected token | Almost always a construct from section 4 — rewrite |
| E020 | `do x` but no `define x` | Add the define or fix spelling |
| E021 (warn) | Variable used before `let` | Add `let` in `when start` |
| E022 | Duplicate `define` name | Rename |
| E023 | Sensor not on target | Change sensor or target |
| W001/W006 | `forever`/`while` with no `wait` | Add `wait 10ms`+ at loop end (100% CPU otherwise) |
| W002 | Redundant `stop` before `move` | Delete the `stop` |
| W004 | Unused define | Call it or delete it |
| W007 | Duplicate event handler | Merge bodies |

---

## 8. Style rules for kid-facing programs

- **< 40 lines** including comments. If it's longer, cut features.
- 2-space indentation inside blocks (cosmetic — parser ignores it — but always do it).
- Open with a 2-line comment: `# Title` and `# What it teaches: ...`.
- Every program starts with a `when start` that says hello and shows an expression —
  kids need immediate proof the robot is alive.
- Pair every `move` with either `for <duration>` or a later `stop`.
- Always `wait` inside `while`/`forever` (10–500 ms).
- Give button_a a fun action and button_b a calm/stop action — kids mash buttons.
- Prefer `show <expression>` over text; expressions work on every target.
- One concept per program (one new loop type, one sensor, one event).

### 9.1 Hello World (any target)

## 10. Debugging checklist

Program won't validate:
1. Read the E010 location — 9 times out of 10 it's a section-4 construct
   (random, list, concat, top-level let/every, nested forever, define params).
2. `say`/`show text` argument must be a double-quoted string literal.
3. Conditions must be comparisons — no bare variables, no `is`.
4. `°` symbol (or bare number), never the word `degrees`.

Validates but compiles with errors:
1. E023 → sensor/target mismatch; check the section-5 matrix.
2. `--strict` failing on W001/W006 → add `wait` to the loop.

Compiles but robot misbehaves:
1. ImportError on boot → `applaa_robot.py` (MicroPython) or AppyRobot library
   (Arduino) missing from the board; flash the runtime first.
2. Action repeats forever near an obstacle → sensor triggers re-fire while true;
   add a flag gate (section 6 pattern).
3. Buttons feel dead on arduino → a long `wait`/dance routine is blocking
   `loop()`; shorten waits, or move to esp32 (async handlers).
4. Robot drives off a table → `move` without `for`; add a duration or `stop`.
5. Timer drifts on arduino → blocking `delay()` elsewhere in `loop()`; expected.
6. `remember` value gone after reflash → flashing erases NVS on some boards;
   re-run once to re-seed.

Simulate before hardware, always:
```bash
npx appyscript simulate robot.appy --sensor-distance=10 --max-ticks=100
npx appyscript simulate robot.appy --shaken --button-a
```
Check `events` for the action sequence and `finalState` for variables/expression.
