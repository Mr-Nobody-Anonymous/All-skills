# M5Stack CoreS3 / CoreS3 SE — Expert Firmware Knowledge

## 1. Hardware Identity — know exactly which board you have

| Property | CoreS3 | CoreS3 SE |
|---|---|---|
| MCU | ESP32-S3 (dual-core LX7 @ 240 MHz) | same |
| Flash / PSRAM | 16 MB flash / 8 MB PSRAM (octal) | 16 MB / 8 MB |
| Screen | 2.0" IPS 320×240, ILI9342C, capacitive touch (FT6336U) | same |
| Camera | GC0308 (0.3 MP) | **none** |
| Mic | dual ES7210 ADC mics | single mic |
| RTC | BM8563 | BM8563 |
| IMU | BMI270 + BMM150 mag | BMI270 (no magnetometer on most SE units) |
| Battery | 500 mAh internal | **none internal** (battery bottom optional) |
| Proximity | LTR-553ALS (light/prox) | none |
| USB | USB-C, native USB-OTG (S3) + no separate UART chip | same |

Critical implication: **the CoreS3 SE has no internal battery** — it dies instantly on USB unplug unless a battery base (e.g., Battery Bottom2) is attached. Don't write "low battery" logic assuming a battery exists.

The ESP32-S3 has **no DAC** (unlike original ESP32). Audio out goes through the **AW88298 I2S amplifier** to the built-in 1 W speaker. Never use `dac` APIs.

## 2. Grove Ports — wiring tables (the #1 source of mistakes)

Three HY2.0-4P (Grove) ports on the bottom edge. Colors and roles:

| Port | Color | Role | Pin 1 (signal) | Pin 2 (signal) | Pin 3 | Pin 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Port A** | Red | I2C (external) | **G1 = SCL** | **G2 = SDA** | 5V | GND |
| **Port B** | Black | GPIO / ADC | **G8** (in) | **G9** (out) | 5V | GND |
| **Port C** | Blue | UART | **G18 = RXD** | **G17 = TXD** | 5V | GND |

Memorize the cable color code on the Grove lead: **yellow = pin 1, white = pin 2, red = 5V, black = GND**.

So on Port A: yellow wire = SCL (G1), white wire = SDA (G2). This is **reversed vs. original M5Stack Core/Core2** where Port A was G22/G21 — never copy old Core pin numbers.

### Internal vs external I2C — two separate buses
- **Internal bus (I2C0)**: G11 = SCL, G12 = SDA. Hosts AXP2101 (0x34), AW9523 (0x58), FT6336U touch (0x38), BM8563 RTC (0x51), BMI270 (0x69), AW88298 amp (0x36), ES7210 (0x40/0x41... varies).
- **External Grove Port A (I2C1)**: G1 = SCL, G2 = SDA. This is where Units plug in.
- **NEVER scan or write blindly to the internal bus.** Writing wrong registers to the AXP2101 (0x34) can cut power to the screen or brown out the board.

In M5 MicroPython, `M5.begin()` configures the internal bus; for Port A units use:
```python
from machine import I2C, Pin
i2c1 = I2C(1, scl=Pin(1), sda=Pin(2), freq=100000)  # Port A
print(i2c1.scan())  # expect e.g. [104] for MPU-style unit at 0x68
```
Start at 100 kHz. Many Grove units (especially with long daisy-chained cables) fail at 400 kHz. Only raise to 400 kHz after the scan is stable.

### Port voltage facts
- Grove ports supply **5 V** on the red wire (boosted from USB/battery), but **GPIO logic is 3.3 V**. Units are designed for this (5 V power, 3.3 V signaling).
- Max combined 5 V Grove output: budget ~500 mA from USB; heavy loads (servo units, NeoPixel strips) need the DC 5 V input or an external supply.
- Port B G8/G9 are also usable as ADC (ADC1 channels). ADC range with 11 dB attenuation ≈ 0–3.1 V, NOT 5 V. Divider needed for 5 V analog signals.

### M-Bus (bottom 30-pin bus)
Stacking modules (Battery Bottom, Servo module, LAN module) use the M-Bus. Pins of note: G35/G36/G37 are SPI (shared with LCD — do not repurpose), G6/G7 free GPIO on some bases. Check the module's schematic; M-Bus pin conflicts with the LCD SPI are the classic "screen goes white when I init my module" bug.

## 3. Power: AXP2101 PMU gotchas (read before anything battery/peripheral related)

The CoreS3 uses an **AXP2101** PMU plus an **AW9523B** GPIO expander on the internal I2C bus. Together they gate power to nearly everything:

| Rail / expander pin | Controls |
|---|---|
| AXP2101 ALDO3 | 3.3 V to camera + sensors |
| AXP2101 ALDO4 | TF card + peripherals (3.3 V) |
| AXP2101 BLDO1 | AW88298 speaker amp power |
| AXP2101 BLDO2 | LCD backlight rail (brightness via AXP, not PWM pin!) |
| AXP2101 DLDO1 | LCD logic / touch |
| AW9523 P0_x / P1_x | Bus power enable, camera reset, speaker enable, **boost 5 V enable for Grove** |

Gotchas, in order of how often they bite:

1. **Screen brightness is NOT a PWM GPIO.** It's the AXP2101 BLDO2 voltage. Use `M5.Lcd.setBrightness(0-255)` (M5Unified/M5 MicroPython) — never try `ledcWrite` on a backlight pin; there isn't one.
2. **`M5.begin()` (or `M5.config()` + begin in Arduino) MUST run first.** It programs the AXP2101 rails. Skip it and: screen stays black, speaker silent, SD card invisible, Grove 5 V may be off. ~90% of "my CoreS3 is dead" reports are a sketch that never called begin.
3. **Grove 5 V can be switched off.** The boost enable goes through the AW9523. M5 firmware enables it in begin; if you bit-bang the AW9523 yourself you can kill power to all attached units.
4. **Battery charge current default is conservative** (~200 mA). Via M5Unified: `M5.Power.setBatteryCharge(true)`; charge current setters exist but leave defaults unless you know the attached battery's rating.
5. **Power off / deep sleep**: `M5.Power.powerOff()` actually cuts rails via AXP. `M5.Power.timerSleep(seconds)` uses the BM8563 RTC to wake. Plain `esp_deep_sleep_start()` leaves AXP rails up → sleep current is tens of mA instead of ~2 mA. Always go through `M5.Power`.
6. **Reading battery**: `M5.Power.getBatteryLevel()` → 0–100; `M5.Power.getBatteryVoltage()` → mV. On a CoreS3 SE without battery these return junk (often 0 or stale) — guard with `M5.Power.getBatteryLevel() >= 0 and isCharging` logic rather than trusting one read.
7. **USB current**: the board can draw >500 mA peaks with WiFi TX + screen + speaker; on weak USB ports this resets the board mid-WiFi-connect. Symptom: reboot exactly when `WiFi.begin()` runs. Fix: better cable/port or attach battery.

## 4. UIFlow2 vs raw MicroPython vs Arduino — choose deliberately

| Option | What it is | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **UIFlow2 firmware** (M5 MicroPython) | M5's MicroPython fork with `M5` module baked in; flash via M5Burner; code via web IDE or any MPY tool (mpremote/Thonny) | Default for education / fast iteration. The `M5`, `Widgets`, `unit`, `hardware` modules only exist here. |
| **Vanilla MicroPython** | Generic ESP32-S3 build | Almost never — you lose all M5 drivers (AXP init, LCD, touch) and must reimplement PMU bring-up. Avoid. |
| **Arduino + M5Unified** | C++ lib `M5Unified` (+ `M5GFX`) | Performance, camera work, BLE-heavy apps, production firmware. |
| **ESP-IDF + M5Unified** | Same lib, IDF component | Advanced production. |

Rule: **UIFlow2 firmware = M5 MicroPython.** "UIFlow" the visual editor just generates this MicroPython. You can ignore blocks entirely and write Python against the same firmware. To get it: M5Burner → CoreS3 → UIFlow2.x firmware → flash at 921600 baud. After flashing, the REPL is available over USB (it's native USB-CDC; if the port vanishes after a crash, hold reset, or hold G0/BtnA-area boot button while plugging in to enter download mode).

Do not mix ecosystems in one answer: `from m5stack import lcd` is the **old Core/UIFlow1 API** and does not exist on CoreS3. The CoreS3 API is `import M5; from M5 import Lcd`.

## 5. M5 MicroPython (UIFlow2) — working patterns

### Minimal correct skeleton
```python
import os, sys, io
import M5
from M5 import Lcd, Speaker, Imu, Touch, Widgets

M5.begin()                 # MANDATORY first — inits AXP2101, LCD, touch, IMU
Widgets.fillScreen(0x222222)

label = Widgets.Label("Hello", 10, 10, 1.0,
                      0xFFFFFF, 0x222222, Widgets.FONTS.DejaVu18)

while True:
    M5.update()            # MANDATORY in loop — feeds touch/buttons/IMU
    if M5.Touch.getCount() > 0:
        x = M5.Touch.getX(); y = M5.Touch.getY()
        label.setText(f"{x},{y}")
```
Two non-negotiables: `M5.begin()` once, `M5.update()` every loop iteration. Without `M5.update()`, touch and the virtual buttons never register.

### Virtual buttons (CoreS3 has NO physical A/B/C buttons)
The bottom strip of the touch screen maps to BtnA/BtnB/BtnC:
```python
if M5.BtnA.wasPressed(): ...
if M5.BtnB.wasHold(): ...      # also: isPressed(), wasReleased(), wasClicked()
```
These only work after `M5.update()`. The left-side physical button is reset/power (hold 6 s = off when on battery), not readable from code.

### LCD direct drawing (M5GFX-style API)
```python
Lcd.fillScreen(0x000000)
Lcd.setTextColor(0x00FF00, 0x000000)
Lcd.setCursor(0, 0)
Lcd.print("line\n")
Lcd.drawCircle(160, 120, 50, 0xFF0000)
Lcd.fillRect(0, 200, 320, 40, 0x0000FF)
Lcd.drawImage("/flash/img.png", 0, 0)   # PNG/JPG/BMP from flash
Lcd.setRotation(1)   # 0-3; default 1 = landscape, USB on left
```
Colors are 24-bit `0xRRGGBB` ints in M5 MicroPython (converted internally to RGB565). Screen is 320×240 in default rotation.

For flicker-free animation use a canvas (sprite):
```python
cv = M5.Lcd.newCanvas(320, 240, 16)   # 16-bit color sprite in PSRAM
cv.fillScreen(0x000000)
cv.drawCircle(x, y, 10, 0xFFFFFF)
cv.push(0, 0)
```

### Speaker (I2S → AW88298, 1 W)
```python
Speaker.setVolumePercentage(0.6)         # 0.0–1.0; >0.8 distorts on the tiny driver
Speaker.tone(2000, 300)                  # freq Hz, duration ms — non-blocking
while Speaker.isPlaying(): pass          # wait if you need sequencing
Speaker.playWavFile("/flash/beep.wav")   # 16-bit PCM WAV; 8/16/22.05/44.1 kHz mono is safest
```
Mistakes: calling `tone()` back-to-back without checking `isPlaying()` truncates notes; WAVs above 44.1 kHz stereo stutter; speaker shares I2S with mic config — don't manually reconfigure I2S pins.

### IMU (BMI270)
```python
ax, ay, az = Imu.getAccel()    # in g; z ≈ +1.0 flat on table
gx, gy, gz = Imu.getGyro()     # deg/s
```
Tilt detection pattern: `pitch = math.degrees(math.atan2(ax, az))`. The BMI270 needs a few hundred ms after begin before readings settle — discard the first ~10 samples. There is no built-in AHRS in MicroPython; do complementary filtering yourself if you need stable angles.

### RTC (BM8563)
```python
from hardware import RTC8563   # UIFlow2
rtc = RTC8563()
rtc.setDateTime((2026, 6, 10, 2, 14, 30, 0))   # y,m,d,weekday,h,m,s
print(rtc.getDateTime())
```
The RTC keeps time when powered off (backed by main battery on CoreS3). For NTP: `import ntptime; ntptime.settime()` after WiFi, then copy into RTC.

### WiFi
```python
import network, time
wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wlan.active(True)
wlan.connect("ssid", "pass")
t0 = time.ticks_ms()
while not wlan.isconnected():
    if time.ticks_diff(time.ticks_ms(), t0) > 15000:
        raise RuntimeError("wifi timeout")
    time.sleep_ms(200)
print(wlan.ifconfig())
```
ESP32-S3 is **2.4 GHz only**. A 5 GHz-only SSID fails silently in a connect loop — always timeout and report.

### Grove Units, the UIFlow2 way
UIFlow2 ships a `unit` package with drivers for the whole unit ecosystem:
```python
from hardware import I2C, UART
from unit import ENVUnit, ToFUnit, PIRUnit, RGBUnit, ServoUnit, UltrasonicI2CUnit

i2c1 = I2C(1, scl=1, sda=2, freq=100000)        # Port A
env = ENVUnit(i2c=i2c1, type=3)                  # ENV III (SHT30 0x44 + QMP6988 0x70)
print(env.read_temperature(), env.read_humidity(), env.read_pressure())

tof = ToFUnit(i2c1)                              # VL53L0X @ 0x29
print(tof.get_distance())                        # mm

pir = PIRUnit((8, 9))                            # Port B — digital in on G8
if pir.get_status(): ...

rgb = RGBUnit((8, 9), number=3)                  # NeoPixel SK6812 on Port B
rgb.set_color(0, 0xFF0000)
```
Pattern: I2C units take the I2C object (Port A); GPIO units take the pin tuple `(in_pin, out_pin)` = `(8, 9)` for Port B; UART units take port C pins `(18, 17)`.

## 6. Arduino / M5Unified — working patterns

`platformio.ini` that actually works:
```ini
[env:cores3]
platform = espressif32
board = m5stack-cores3
framework = arduino
monitor_speed = 115200
build_flags = -DBOARD_HAS_PSRAM -DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1
lib_deps = m5stack/M5Unified@^0.2.7
```
`ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1` is required or `Serial.print` goes nowhere (native USB).

```cpp
#include <M5Unified.h>

void setup() {
  auto cfg = M5.config();
  M5.begin(cfg);                       // AXP2101 + LCD + touch + IMU init
  M5.Display.setTextSize(2);
  M5.Display.setBrightness(128);
  M5.Speaker.setVolume(128);
}

void loop() {
  M5.update();                         // touch + virtual buttons
  if (M5.BtnA.wasPressed()) M5.Speaker.tone(2000, 100);

  auto t = M5.Touch.getDetail();
  if (t.wasPressed()) M5.Display.fillCircle(t.x, t.y, 5, GREEN);

  float ax, ay, az;
  if (M5.Imu.getAccel(&ax, &ay, &az)) { /* g units */ }
}
```
Use `M5Unified`, NOT the old `M5CoreS3` or `M5Stack` libraries — those have stale AXP code and conflict with M5Unified. `M5.Display` is an M5GFX `LGFX` — full sprite support:
```cpp
M5Canvas canvas(&M5.Display);
canvas.createSprite(320, 240);        // lives in PSRAM
canvas.fillSprite(BLACK);
canvas.drawString("60fps", 10, 10);
canvas.pushSprite(0, 0);
```

External I2C in Arduino: `Wire.begin(2, 1);  // SDA=G2, SCL=G1 — Port A`. `Wire1` is claimed by M5Unified for the internal bus; don't re-begin it.

UART Port C: `Serial2.begin(115200, SERIAL_8N1, 18, 17); // RX=G18, TX=G17`.

## 7. Unit ecosystem — I2C address map (collision avoidance)

Common Grove units and their fixed addresses on Port A:

| Unit | Chip | Addr |
|---|---|---|
| ENV III / ENV IV | SHT30/SHT40 + QMP6988/BMP280 | 0x44 + 0x70 / 0x76 |
| ToF | VL53L0X | 0x29 |
| Ultrasonic (I2C) | RCWL-9620 | 0x57 |
| TVOC/eCO2 | SGP30 | 0x58 ⚠ collides with internal AW9523 — fine, it's a different bus, but never wire it to internal I2C |
| Heart (MAX30100) | MAX30100 | 0x57 ⚠ collides with Ultrasonic |
| ADC Unit | ADS1100 | 0x48 |
| DAC Unit | MCP4725 | 0x60 |
| EXT.IO2 | STM32 | 0x45 |
| Joystick | custom | 0x52 |
| 8Servos / PCA9685-based | PCA9685 | 0x40 |
| PaHub (I2C hub) | PCA9548A | 0x70 ⚠ collides with QMP6988 (ENV III) |

Rules: (1) daisy-chaining I2C units is fine if addresses differ; (2) same-address units need a **PaHub**; (3) PaHub at 0x70 + ENV III's QMP6988 at 0x70 on the same root bus = broken — put the ENV unit behind the hub. Always `i2c.scan()` at startup and assert expected addresses before reading; a missing unit otherwise manifests as `OSError: [Errno 19] ENODEV` mid-run.

GPIO units (PIR, Dual Button, Relay, RGB LED, Vibrator) go on **Port B only** (G8 in, G9 out). UART units (GPS, Finger, CamS3-as-serial, LoRa) go on **Port C** (G18 RX, G17 TX). Plugging a UART unit into Port A does nothing and damages nothing — it just won't talk; check port assignment first when a unit is "dead."

Servo note: a single hobby servo's signal can run from G9 (Port B) but power it from the 5 V pin only for micro servos (<300 mA stall). Anything bigger: external 5–6 V supply, common ground, signal from G9.

## 8. Free GPIO budget (what you can actually use)

Pins exposed and safe: **G1, G2 (Port A), G8, G9 (Port B), G17, G18 (Port C), G5, G6, G7, G13, G14** (M-Bus, check base module conflicts). Reserved — do not touch: G35/36/37 (LCD SPI + PSRAM octal lines on S3!), G11/G12 (internal I2C), G0 (boot strap), G45/46 (straps). Repurposing G35–37 bricks the running firmware until reflash. ADC-capable among free pins: G8, G9 (ADC1). PWM (LEDC) works on any free GPIO.

## 9. Debugging checklist (run top to bottom)

1. **Black screen, no life** → Did the code call `M5.begin()` before anything else? Is the brightness set to 0? Try `M5.Lcd.setBrightness(200)`.
2. **No serial output (Arduino)** → `ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1` missing, or you opened the monitor before the native USB re-enumerated. Add `while(!Serial && millis()<3000);`.
3. **Port disappears / can't flash** → crashed firmware holding USB. Power off fully (hold reset/power 6+ s or unplug+battery off), then hold the BOOT (G0) button while plugging USB → download mode → flash.
4. **Touch/buttons never fire** → missing `M5.update()` in the loop.
5. **I2C unit ENODEV** → wrong port (unit on B/C instead of A), wrong bus (used internal G11/12), or address collision. Run `i2c.scan()` on bus 1 (G1/G2) and compare against the table above. Then drop freq to 100 kHz.
6. **Board reboots when WiFi starts** → USB power brown-out. Better cable/port, or battery attached. Watch for `rst:0x10 (RTCWDT_RTC_RESET)` in boot log.
7. **Speaker silent** → volume 0, or audio file format unsupported (must be PCM WAV), or another sketch reconfigured I2S. `Speaker.tone(2000,200)` is the minimal smoke test.
8. **High sleep current** → used raw esp deep sleep instead of `M5.Power.timerSleep()` / `M5.Power.deepSleep()`; AXP rails still on.
9. **SD card not found** → ALDO4 off (begin not called), or card >32 GB not FAT32. CS is G4, shared SPI with LCD — use M5's SD helpers, don't roll your own SPI init.
10. **IMU all zeros** → reading before init settled; wait 200 ms after begin, discard first samples. On SE, magnetometer calls fail — there is no BMM150.
11. **Unit works alone, fails daisy-chained** → bus capacitance. Shorten cables, drop to 100 kHz, or insert PaHub.
12. **Camera code on an SE** → no camera. `esp_camera_init` will fail; gate camera features on board detect.

## 10. Anti-patterns (things AIs/beginners always get wrong)

- Using old Core/Core2 pin numbers (G21/G22 I2C, G39 buttons). CoreS3 is a different pinout entirely.
- `from m5stack import lcd` / `lcd.print()` — UIFlow1 API, does not exist on CoreS3.
- PWM-ing a "backlight pin" — brightness is the AXP2101 BLDO2 rail.
- Polling physical BtnA/B/C GPIOs — they're touch-virtual; only `M5.BtnX` after `M5.update()` works.
- `dacWrite()` / `machine.DAC` — ESP32-S3 has no DAC; audio is I2S only.
- Assuming 5 V-tolerant GPIO — it's 3.3 V logic; 5 V sensor outputs need a divider.
- Writing to I2C 0x34 (AXP2101) directly "to set brightness" — use M5.Power/M5.Lcd APIs; raw writes can power-cycle rails.
- Blocking `time.sleep(10)` loops in MicroPython while expecting touch to respond — touch needs `M5.update()` cadence ≤ ~50 ms.
- Forgetting WiFi is 2.4 GHz only.
- Mixing `M5Unified` with legacy `M5CoreS3.h` in one Arduino project — duplicate AXP init, undefined behavior.
