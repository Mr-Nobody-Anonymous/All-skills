# Cold Outreach Writer

## Overview

Creates personalized, high-reply-rate cold outreach emails and DMs. Uses proven frameworks that respect the recipient's time while clearly communicating value.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Outreach

Ask the user:
1. **Who are you reaching out to?** (role, company type, industry)
2. **What do you want?** (meeting, intro, sale, partnership)
3. **What's in it for them?** (your value prop)
4. **Any personalization hooks?** (shared connections, their content, recent news)
5. **Channel**: Email, LinkedIn DM, Twitter DM?

### Step 2: Choose the Framework

| Framework | Best For | Structure |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **PAS** (Problem-Agitate-Solve) | Pain-aware prospects | Problem → Make it urgent → Your solution |
| **AIDA** (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action) | Cold prospects | Hook → Relevance → Value → Ask |
| **Before-After-Bridge** | Transformation sells | Current state → Dream state → How you get them there |
| **QVC** (Question-Value-CTA) | Short and direct | Relevant question → Quick value → Simple ask |
| **Case Study Lead** | Social proof heavy | Result you got someone like them → Offer the same |

### Step 3: Write the Email

**Rules for high-performing cold emails:**

1. **Subject line**: 3-5 words, lowercase, sounds like a friend wrote it
2. **Opening line**: About THEM, not you (personalized)
3. **Body**: Max 3 short paragraphs, under 100 words total
4. **Value prop**: One specific, measurable result
5. **CTA**: One question, easy to say yes to
6. **No attachments**, no links (first email)
7. **P.S. line** (optional): Adds human touch

**Subject line formulas:**
- `quick question about [their company]`
- `[mutual connection] suggested I reach out`
- `idea for [their specific goal]`
- `[their company] + [your company]`
- `saw your [post/talk/article] on [topic]`

**Opening line formulas:**
- "Saw your [specific post/article] about [topic] — [genuine reaction]."
- "Congrats on [specific achievement] — [why it impressed you]."
- "[Mutual connection] mentioned you're working on [specific thing]."
- "I noticed [specific observation about their business]."

### Step 4: Write Follow-Up Sequence

Create 3 follow-ups:

**Follow-up 1 (3 days later)**: Quick bump, add new value
**Follow-up 2 (5 days later)**: Different angle or case study  
**Follow-up 3 (7 days later)**: Breakup email (creates urgency)

### Step 5: Generate Variations

Create 2-3 variations for A/B testing with different:
- Subject lines
- Opening hooks
- Value angles
- CTAs

## Output Format

```markdown
# Cold Outreach: [Target Audience]

## Campaign Overview
- **Target**: [who]
