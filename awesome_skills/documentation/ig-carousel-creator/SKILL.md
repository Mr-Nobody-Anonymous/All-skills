# Instagram Carousel Creator

## Overview

Creates scroll-stopping Instagram carousels optimized for saves, shares, and engagement. Follows proven carousel frameworks with hook slides, value progression, and strong CTAs.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Carousel

Ask the user:
1. **Topic**: What's the carousel about?
2. **Goal**: Educate, sell, build authority, or drive engagement?
3. **Audience**: Who is this for?
4. **Slide count**: 7-10 slides (default: 10)
5. **Brand style**: Any specific colors, fonts, or branding guidelines?

### Step 2: Choose the Framework

Select the best carousel framework based on the goal:

| Framework | Best For | Structure |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Listicle** | Tips, tools, resources | Hook → Items 1-8 → CTA |
| **Story Arc** | Case studies, results | Hook → Problem → Journey → Result → CTA |
| **Myth Buster** | Authority building | Hook → Myth/Truth pairs → CTA |
| **Step-by-Step** | Tutorials, how-tos | Hook → Steps 1-7 → CTA |
| **Before/After** | Transformations | Hook → Before → Process → After → CTA |
| **Hot Take** | Engagement/controversy | Bold claim → Supporting points → CTA |

### Step 3: Write the Slides

**Slide 1 — THE HOOK (Most Critical)**
- Pattern interrupt — something unexpected
- Create a knowledge gap
- Use power words: "Stop", "Warning", "Nobody talks about", "The truth about"
- Keep it under 10 words
- Must work as a standalone thumbnail

**Slides 2-8 — THE VALUE**
- One idea per slide
- Progressive depth (simple → complex)
- Each slide should make them want the next one
- Use contrast, numbers, and specifics
- Mix text-heavy and text-light slides

**Slide 9 — THE BRIDGE**
- Summarize the key insight
- Create desire for more
- Transition to the CTA

**Slide 10 — THE CTA**
- Clear single action
- Options: Follow, Save, Comment, DM, Link in bio
- Make the action feel natural, not forced

### Step 4: Write Caption

Structure:
1. **Opening line** — hooks scrollers (shows in preview)
2. **Context** — why this matters (2-3 sentences)
3. **Key takeaway** — the #1 thing to remember
4. **Engagement hook** — question or comment prompt
5. **Hashtags** — 5-10 relevant hashtags (at bottom or in comment)

### Step 5: Format Output

## Output Format

```markdown
# Instagram Carousel: [Topic]

## Carousel Details
- **Slides**: [number]
- **Framework**: [framework used]
- **Goal**: [educate/sell/authority/engage]

---

## SLIDE 1 (HOOK)
**Headline**: [Big bold text]
**Subtext**: [Supporting line if needed]
**Visual note**: [Background/image suggestion]

## SLIDE 2
**Headline**: [Main point]
**Body**: [Supporting text — keep under 40 words]
**Visual note**: [Any design suggestions]

[Continue for all slides...]

## SLIDE [Last] (CTA)
**Headline**: [Call to action]
**Body**: [Why they should take action]
**Visual note**: [Design suggestion]

---

## CAPTION
[Full caption text]

## HASHTAGS
#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 ...

## ALT TEXT
[Accessibility description]
```

## Engagement Optimization Rules

1. **Hook test**: Cover slides 2-10 — does slide 1 alone make you want to swipe?
2. **Swipe test**: Each slide must create curiosity for the next
3. **Save trigger**: Include at least one "reference-worthy" slide people will save
4. **Share trigger**: Include at least one "tag someone who needs this" moment
5. **Comment trigger**: End with a question or "Comment [word] for the link"
