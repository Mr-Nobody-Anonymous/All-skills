# Blog to Social Repurposer

## Overview
Takes one piece of long-form content and creates 10-15 social media posts across multiple platforms.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Input
Accept the blog post, article, or long-form content. Ask:
1. **Platforms**: Where to post? (LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter/X, Facebook)
2. **Tone**: Match original or adjust per platform?
3. **Posts needed**: How many per platform?

### Step 2: Extract Content Atoms
From one blog post, pull out:
- Key statistics or data points
- Quotable one-liners
- Step-by-step processes
- Contrarian takes or hot opinions
- Before/after comparisons
- Lists or frameworks
- Personal stories or anecdotes

### Step 3: Create Platform-Specific Posts

**LinkedIn** (long-form, professional):
- Story + lesson format
- Data-driven insights
- 1,000-1,500 characters

**Instagram** (visual, carousel-friendly):
- Carousel: key points as slides
- Single post: one powerful insight
- Caption under 300 words

**Twitter/X** (short, punchy):
- Single tweets: one insight per tweet
- Thread: break down the full article
- Under 280 characters per tweet

**Facebook** (conversational):
- Question-led posts
- Community discussion starters
- 100-300 words
