# Ad Copy Creator

## Overview
Creates platform-specific ad copy optimized for clicks, conversions, and ROAS. Includes multiple variations for A/B testing.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Campaign
1. **Platform**: Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, TikTok, or YouTube?
2. **Objective**: Awareness, traffic, leads, or sales?
3. **Product/service**: What are you advertising?
4. **Target audience**: Demographics, interests, pain points
5. **Budget range**: Helps calibrate copy aggressiveness
6. **Landing page URL**: Where does the ad send traffic?

### Step 2: Platform-Specific Formats

**Facebook/Instagram Ads:**
| Element | Specs |
|---------|-------|
| Primary text | 125 chars (visible before "see more"), up to 2,200 |
| Headline | 27 chars ideal, 40 max |
| Description | 27 chars ideal |
| CTA button | Shop Now, Learn More, Sign Up, Download, etc. |

**Google Search Ads:**
| Element | Specs |
|---------|-------|
| Headlines | 3 headlines × 30 chars each |
| Descriptions | 2 descriptions × 90 chars each |
| Display URL path | 2 paths × 15 chars |

**LinkedIn Ads:**
| Element | Specs |
|---------|-------|
| Introductory text | 150 chars (before truncation) |
| Headline | 70 chars max |
| Description | 100 chars |

**TikTok Ads:**
| Element | Specs |
|---------|-------|
| Ad text | 100 chars (80 visible) |
| CTA | Pre-set options |
| Hook | First 3 seconds of script |

### Step 3: Apply Copy Frameworks

| Framework | Structure | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **PAS** | Problem → Agitate → Solve | Pain-aware audiences |
| **AIDA** | Attention → Interest → Desire → Action | Cold audiences |
| **BAB** | Before → After → Bridge | Transformation offers |
| **4U** | Urgent, Unique, Useful, Ultra-specific | Direct response |
| **Star-Story-Solution** | Character → Journey → Product | Story-driven ads |

### Step 4: Generate Variations

Create minimum 5 variations per platform:
- 2 × pain-focused (address the problem)
- 2 × benefit-focused (show the transformation)
- 1 × social proof (results/testimonials)

### Step 5: Write the Ads

For each variation include:
- All required copy elements per platform specs
- CTA selection with reasoning
- Audience targeting suggestion
- Creative/visual direction (what image or video to pair with)
