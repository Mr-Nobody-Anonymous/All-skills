# LinkedIn Post Writer

## Overview

Creates scroll-stopping LinkedIn posts that build authority, drive engagement, and generate leads. Optimized for the LinkedIn algorithm and professional audience behavior.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Post

Ask the user:
1. **Topic**: What's the post about?
2. **Goal**: Awareness, engagement, leads, or authority?
3. **Angle**: Personal story, contrarian take, lesson learned, or how-to?
4. **Audience**: Who should care about this?

### Step 2: Choose the Framework

| Framework | Best For | Hook Style |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Story → Lesson** | Personal brand | "3 years ago, I..." |
| **Contrarian Take** | Engagement/debate | "Unpopular opinion:" |
| **Listicle** | Saves & shares | "X things I learned..." |
| **Before/After** | Transformation | "I went from X to Y..." |
| **Observation** | Thought leadership | "I've noticed something..." |
| **How I Did X** | Authority | "Here's how I [result]:" |
| **Hot Take** | Virality | "Everyone is wrong about..." |

### Step 3: Write the Post

**THE HOOK (First 2 lines — CRITICAL)**
- These show in preview before "see more"
- Must create curiosity gap
- Use pattern interrupts
- Short, punchy lines
- No hashtags or emojis in hook

**THE BODY**
- One idea per line
- Use line breaks generously
- Mix short and medium lines
- Include specific numbers/results
- Add a "twist" or unexpected insight
- Write at 8th grade reading level

**THE CLOSE**
- Summarize the key takeaway
- End with engagement hook (question or prompt)
- Add relevant hashtags (3-5 max, at the very end)

### Step 4: Optimize for Algorithm

**Engagement boosters:**
- Ask a question at the end
- Use "agree or disagree?" format
- Include a "save this for later" moment
- Tag relevant people (only if genuinely relevant)
- Respond to every comment in first hour

**Format rules:**
- Max 3,000 characters
- One sentence per line for readability
- No external links (kills reach) — put links in comments
- First comment strategy: add context, links, or resources there
- Post between 7-9 AM in your audience's timezone
