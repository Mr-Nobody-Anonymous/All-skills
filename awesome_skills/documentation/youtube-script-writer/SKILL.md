# YouTube Script Writer

## Overview
Creates retention-optimized YouTube scripts with hooks, pattern interrupts, and strategic CTAs.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Video
1. **Topic**: What's the video about?
2. **Length**: Short (5-8 min), Medium (10-15 min), or Long (20+ min)?
3. **Style**: Tutorial, listicle, story, opinion, or review?
4. **Audience**: Who's watching and what do they already know?
5. **CTA goal**: Subscribe, buy, download, or watch next?

### Step 2: Write the Hook (First 30 Seconds)

**Hook formulas:**
- **The Promise**: "By the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to [outcome]"
- **The Shock**: "Most people get [topic] completely wrong. Here's why..."
- **The Story**: "Last month, I [did something] and the results blew my mind"
- **The Question**: "What if I told you [surprising claim]?"
- **The Proof**: "I [achieved result] in [timeframe], and I'm going to show you how"

**Anti-skip elements** (first 30 sec must include):
- Statement of value (what they'll learn)
- Proof you're credible
- Pattern interrupt (something unexpected)

### Step 3: Script Structure

```
[0:00-0:30] HOOK — Why they should keep watching
[0:30-1:00] CONTEXT — Quick background/setup  
[1:00-X:00] CONTENT — Main value (use sections below)
[Last 2 min] CTA — What to do next + subscribe

Within CONTENT, every 2-3 minutes include:
- Pattern interrupt (change pace, visual, or energy)
- Open loop ("but first..." / "I'll get to that in a second")
- Retention hook ("this next part is the most important")
```

### Step 4: Write Each Section

For each section of the script:
- **On-screen text suggestion**: Key words to display
- **B-roll suggestion**: What to show visually
- **Energy note**: Pace and tone guidance
- **Retention device**: How to keep them watching through this part

## Output Format

```markdown
# YouTube Script: [Video Title]

## Video Details
- **Title options**: [3 title variations]
- **Thumbnail concept**: [description]
- **Target length**: [X minutes]

## Title & Thumbnail Options
