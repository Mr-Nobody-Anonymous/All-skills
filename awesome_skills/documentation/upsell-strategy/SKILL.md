# Upsell Strategy Designer

## Overview
Creates systematic upsell and cross-sell strategies to increase customer lifetime value and average order value.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Current Offers
1. **Products/services**: List everything you sell with prices
2. **Current AOV**: Average order value
3. **Customer segments**: Who buys what?
4. **Purchase patterns**: What do people buy together?

### Step 2: Design the Value Ladder

```
FREE: [Lead magnet / free trial]
  ↓
ENTRY ($X): [Lowest-priced offer]
  ↓
CORE ($XX): [Main offer]
  ↓
PREMIUM ($XXX): [High-value offer]
  ↓
VIP ($XXXX): [Done-for-you / exclusive]
```

### Step 3: Map Upsell Opportunities

| Trigger Point | Upsell Offer | Type | Expected Conversion |
|--------------|-------------|------|-------------------|
| At checkout | [offer] | Order bump | 15-25% |
| Post-purchase | [offer] | Upsell | 10-20% |
| After onboarding | [offer] | Cross-sell | 5-15% |
| At renewal | [offer] | Upgrade | 20-30% |
| Usage milestone | [offer] | Expansion | 10-20% |

### Step 4: Write the Upsell Scripts/Copy

For each upsell, provide:
- **Trigger**: When to present it
- **Headline**: The offer in one line
- **Value prop**: Why they need this NOW
- **Price anchor**: Show the value vs cost
- **Urgency**: Why now, not later
- **Copy**: Full email/page/popup text

## Output Format

```markdown
# Upsell Strategy: [Business Name]

## Value Ladder
[Visual representation]

## Current Metrics
- AOV: $[X]
- Target AOV: $[X]
- Projected revenue increase: [X]%

## Upsell Opportunities

### Opportunity 1: [Name]
- **Type**: Order bump / Upsell / Cross-sell
- **Trigger**: [when to present]
- **Offer**: [what they get]
- **Price**: $[X] (value: $[X])
- **Expected conversion**: [X]%
- **Revenue impact**: $[X]/month

**Copy**:
> [Full upsell copy]

[Repeat for each opportunity]

## Implementation Priority
1. [Highest impact, easiest to implement]
2. [Next priority]
3. [etc.]

## Revenue Projection
| Upsell | Monthly Revenue | Annual Impact |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| [Upsell 1] | $X | $X |
| [Upsell 2] | $X | $X |
| **Total** | **$X** | **$X** |
```
