# Proposal Generator

## Overview

Creates professional, conversion-optimized client proposals that clearly communicate value, scope, deliverables, pricing, and terms. Designed to close deals.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Proposal Details

Ask the user:
1. **Client name & company**
2. **Service/project** being proposed
3. **Client's problem** (what pain are you solving?)
4. **Your solution** (what will you deliver?)
5. **Pricing** (fixed, retainer, hourly, or tiered?)
6. **Timeline** (estimated duration)
7. **Any discovery call notes** or context

### Step 2: Structure the Proposal

Follow this proven proposal structure:

**1. Cover Page**
- Your company name/logo placeholder
- Client name
- Proposal title
- Date
- Confidentiality note

**2. Executive Summary (1 paragraph)**
- Restate their problem in their words
- Preview your solution
- Hint at the expected outcome
- Keep it under 100 words

**3. The Problem**
- Describe their current situation
- Quantify the cost of inaction
- Show you understand their world
- Use their language, not yours

**4. The Solution**
- Your approach (how you'll solve it)
- Why this approach works
- What makes you qualified
- Brief methodology overview

**5. Scope & Deliverables**
- Numbered list of exactly what's included
- Clear boundaries (what's NOT included)
- Deliverable format (files, reports, access, etc.)
- Revision/feedback rounds included

**6. Timeline & Milestones**
- Phase-by-phase breakdown
- Key milestones with dates
- Dependencies (what you need from them)
- Review/approval checkpoints

**7. Investment**
- Pricing (present value first, price second)
- Payment schedule
- What's included at each tier (if applicable)
- Optional add-ons

**8. Why [Your Company]**
- Relevant experience
- 1-2 mini case studies or results
- Unique qualifications
- Social proof

**9. Next Steps**
- Clear CTA (what to do to move forward)
- Proposal validity period
- How to accept

**10. Terms & Conditions**
- Payment terms
- Cancellation policy
- IP ownership
- Confidentiality

### Step 3: Apply Persuasion Principles

- **Anchoring**: Present highest-value option first
- **Social proof**: Include results from similar clients
- **Urgency**: Add proposal expiration date
- **Risk reversal**: Include guarantees or pilot options
- **Specificity**: Use exact numbers, not ranges

## Output Format

Generate the proposal in markdown, ready to be converted to PDF or DOCX:

```markdown
# Proposal: [Project Name]
## Prepared for: [Client Name], [Company]
## Prepared by: [Your Name], [Your Company]
## Date: [Date]
