# Differential Privacy Epsilon Budgeting and GDPR DPIA Auditing

## Overview & Core Principles
Quantify privacy loss with $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy mechanisms and perform rigorous General Data Protection Regulation Data Protection Impact Assessments.

### Differential Privacy & DPIA Standards
1. **$(\epsilon, \delta)$-Differential Privacy Guarantee**:
   - An algorithm $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP if for all neighboring datasets $D, D'$ differing by at most one individual, and all query outcomes $S$:
     $$\Pr[\mathcal{M}(D) \in S] \le e^{\epsilon} \Pr[\mathcal{M}(D') \in S] + \delta$$
2. **Laplace Mechanism for Scalar Queries**:
   - For query $f$ with sensitivity $\Delta f = \max ||f(D) - f(D')||_1$, add noise:
     $$Y \sim \text{Laplace}\left(0, \frac{\Delta f}{\epsilon}\right)$$
3. **GDPR DPIA Execution Mandate**:
   - Mandatory trigger: Systematic profiling with significant legal effects, large-scale processing of special categories (health, biometric), or public surveillance.
   - Required sections: Systematic description of processing, necessity and proportionality assessment, risk assessment to rights and freedoms of data subjects, mitigating controls.
