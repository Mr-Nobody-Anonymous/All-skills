# Sales Objection Handler

## Overview
Creates comprehensive objection-handling scripts that turn "no" into "tell me more." Covers pricing, timing, competition, authority, and trust objections.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Context
1. **What do you sell?** (product/service + price range)
2. **Who do you sell to?** (buyer persona)
3. **Sales process**: Inbound, outbound, or referral?
4. **Common objections**: What do you hear most?
5. **Biggest competitor**: Who do they compare you to?

### Step 2: Map the Objection Categories

| Category | Common Phrases |
|----------|---------------|
| **Price** | "Too expensive", "Can't afford it", "Cheaper options exist" |
| **Timing** | "Not now", "Maybe next quarter", "Too busy" |
| **Authority** | "Need to check with my boss", "Not my decision" |
| **Need** | "We're fine as is", "Not a priority", "Don't see the value" |
| **Trust** | "Never heard of you", "How do I know it works?", "Seems risky" |
| **Competition** | "We're looking at [competitor]", "Already using [tool]" |
| **Inertia** | "We've always done it this way", "Change is hard" |

### Step 3: Build Response Scripts

For each objection, provide:

**The LAER Framework:**
1. **Listen** — Acknowledge what they said (don't argue)
2. **Acknowledge** — Validate their concern
3. **Explore** — Ask a question to understand the real issue
4. **Respond** — Address with value, proof, or reframe

**Script format:**
```
OBJECTION: "[Exact words they say]"

ACKNOWLEDGE: "[Validation — show you understand]"

EXPLORE: "[Question that uncovers the real concern]"

RESPOND: "[Your response addressing the root cause]"

PROOF: "[Case study, stat, or example that backs it up]"

REDIRECT: "[Question that moves the conversation forward]"
```

### Step 4: Create the Playbook

## Output Format

```markdown
# Objection Handling Playbook: [Your Product/Service]

## Quick Reference Card
| Objection | One-Line Response | Page |
|-----------|------------------|------|
| "Too expensive" | "Compared to what?" | #price |
| "Not now" | "When would be better, and why?" | #timing |
| [etc.] | | |

## PRICE OBJECTIONS

### "It's too expensive"
**What they really mean**: [interpretation]

**Response**:
> "I appreciate you being upfront about that. Can I ask — when you say too expensive, are you comparing it to something specific, or is it about the total investment?"

**If comparing to competitor**: [response]
**If budget concern**: [response]
**If value concern**: [response]

**Proof point**: "[Client] thought the same thing, but after [X months] they saw [specific result]."

**Redirect**: "If budget weren't a factor, would this be the right solution for you?"
