# Twitter/X Thread Writer

## Overview
Creates high-engagement threads optimized for retweets, bookmarks, and follower growth.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Thread
1. **Topic**: What's the thread about?
2. **Goal**: Grow followers, drive traffic, or sell?
3. **Length**: 5-15 tweets
4. **Angle**: Hot take, how-to, story, or breakdown?

### Step 2: Choose the Framework

| Framework | Structure | Hook Style |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **How-to** | Problem → Steps → Result | "Here's exactly how to [X]:" |
| **Breakdown** | Topic → Analysis → Insight | "I analyzed [X]. Here's what I found:" |
| **Story** | Setup → Journey → Lesson | "A year ago, I [situation]. Thread:" |
| **Listicle** | Hook → Items → Summary | "X [things] that will [benefit]:" |
| **Contrarian** | Bold claim → Evidence → Reframe | "Everyone is wrong about [X]. Here's why:" |

### Step 3: Write the Thread

**Tweet 1 (HOOK — most important):**
- Must work standalone in the timeline
- Create massive curiosity gap
- End with "🧵" or "Thread:" or "↓"
- Under 200 characters ideal

**Tweets 2-N (VALUE):**
- One point per tweet
- Start each with a strong first word
- Use numbers, specifics, results
- Add line breaks for readability
- Every 3rd tweet = mini-hook to keep reading

**Final Tweet (CTA):**
- Summarize the takeaway
- Ask for RT/bookmark
- Self-reply with additional resource or link
- Tag relevant people (sparingly)
