# Customer Journey Mapper

## Overview
Maps the complete customer journey from first touch to repeat purchase and advocacy, identifying key touchpoints, emotions, and optimization opportunities.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Journey
1. **Customer persona**: Who is taking this journey?
2. **Product/service**: What are they buying?
3. **Sales cycle**: How long from awareness to purchase?
4. **Channels**: Where do they discover and interact with you?

### Step 2: Map the Stages

| Stage | Goal | Key Question |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Awareness** | They know you exist | "How do they find me?" |
| **Consideration** | They're evaluating options | "Why should they choose me?" |
| **Decision** | They're ready to buy | "What pushes them over the edge?" |
| **Onboarding** | First experience after buying | "How do I deliver the 'aha moment'?" |
| **Retention** | They keep coming back | "How do I keep them engaged?" |
| **Advocacy** | They refer others | "How do I turn them into promoters?" |

### Step 3: Detail Each Stage

For each stage, document:
- **Touchpoints**: Where they interact with you
- **Actions**: What they do
- **Thoughts**: What they're thinking
- **Emotions**: How they feel (😊 → 😐 → 😤)
- **Pain points**: What frustrates them
- **Opportunities**: How to improve the experience
- **Content needed**: What content serves them here
- **Metrics**: How to measure success at this stage
