# Pricing Optimizer

## Overview
Analyzes market positioning and creates optimized pricing strategies with tiers, anchoring, and packaging.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Context
1. **Product/service**: What are you pricing?
2. **Current price**: (if existing)
3. **Competitors**: What do alternatives cost?
4. **Costs**: What does it cost you to deliver?
5. **Value delivered**: What's the ROI for the customer?
6. **Target customer**: Who's buying and what's their budget?

### Step 2: Analyze Pricing Models

| Model | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|-------|----------|------|------|
| **One-time** | Products, templates | Simple, high AOV | No recurring revenue |
| **Subscription** | SaaS, ongoing services | Predictable revenue | Churn risk |
| **Tiered** | Different segments | Captures more market | Complex to manage |
| **Usage-based** | API, volume services | Scales with value | Unpredictable revenue |
| **Value-based** | Consulting, high-ticket | Highest margins | Harder to sell |
| **Freemium** | Growth-focused | Low friction | Conversion challenge |

### Step 3: Design the Pricing
