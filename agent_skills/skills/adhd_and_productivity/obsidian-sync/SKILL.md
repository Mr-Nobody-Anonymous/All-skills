# Obsidian Vault Sync

## Purpose

Keep an Obsidian vault on disk in sync with a working folder of notes, daily logs,
inbox items, and TODOs produced by other skills (`daily-journal`, `unlazy`,
`adhd-task-breakdown`, etc.). The skill preserves frontmatter, internal links, and
the user's tagging conventions, and it never silently overwrites a note that has
changed on both sides.

## When to Use

- The user has a vault path and a working folder path
- A new note was just created in the working folder and needs to land in the vault
- A daily journal was generated and should be appended to the vault
- The user changed a note in the vault and wants the change reflected elsewhere

## When NOT to Use

- The user does not have an Obsidian vault (no action â€” exit)
- The vault is encrypted with a passphrase that has not been provided
- The user wants notes deleted from the vault (this skill never deletes)

## Capabilities

- Copy new files from the working folder into the vault under the right path
- Preserve YAML frontmatter exactly; never rewrite it
- Convert relative links (`[[Note]]`) only when the target is in a different folder
- Detect conflicts (file changed on both sides since last sync) and ask the user
- Maintain a `.sync-state.json` with checksums and last-seen mtimes
- Dry-run mode: report what would happen, change nothing

## Inputs

- `--vault PATH`  â€” the Obsidian vault root
- `--source PATH` â€” the working folder
- `--dry-run`     â€” show what would change, change nothing
- `--strategy merge|mirror|new-only` (default: `merge`)

## Workflow

1. **Load `.sync-state.json`** from the vault. If absent, do a full scan.
2. **Walk the source folder** and compute checksums.
3. **Compare** with the vault. Three buckets: `new`, `updated-source`, `conflict`.
4. **For `new`**: copy file into the vault, preserving relative path.
5. **For `updated-source`**: copy over the vault copy; record new checksum.
6. **For `conflict`**: write both versions to `<vault>/.conflicts/<ts>/` and ask the user.
7. **For files only in the vault**: leave alone (mirror strategy would copy them out).
8. **Write `.sync-state.json`**.

## Tools

- Filesystem copy / checksum (`sha256sum`, `Get-FileHash`, `shasum`)
- YAML parser (preserve order, do not re-serialize unless changed)
- Optional: `git` for a pre-sync safety commit in the vault

## Examples

**User:** "Sync today's journal into my vault."
**Response:** Vault: `~/Notes`. Source: `~/Working/2026-02-09.md`. Result: copied
under `daily/`. No conflicts.

**User:** "Mirror my project folder into Obsidian."
**Response:** Strategy: `mirror`. 12 new notes, 3 updated, 1 conflict
(`projects/alpha.md` changed in both). Conflict saved to `~/Notes/.conflicts/...`.

## Safety

- Never delete files from the vault
- Never overwrite a vault file that has changed locally without asking
- Always write conflicts to a separate folder, never in place
- Prefer `git commit` inside the vault before any change

## Pairs Well With

- `daily-journal` (provides the daily note)
- `context-summarize` (produces a note-ready summary)
- `voice-to-action` (audio becomes a vault note)
