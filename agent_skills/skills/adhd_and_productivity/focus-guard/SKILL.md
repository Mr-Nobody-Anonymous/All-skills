# Focus Guard

## Purpose

Eliminate the digital distractions that break a deep-work session, using one reversible
command. The skill is intentionally idempotent: it does not change *what* the user is
working on, only what is competing for attention.

## When to Use

- A time block has just started (see `time-blocking`)
- The user reports being pulled into Slack / email / tabs
- A focus session needs to survive the next 25 to 90 minutes

## When NOT to Use

- The user is on-call or handling an active incident (notifications must stay on)
- The user has an upcoming meeting in the next 10 minutes

## Capabilities

- Enable OS-level Do Not Disturb / Focus mode for a defined window
- Mute or snooze Slack, email, and notification centers
- Close, hide, or park distracting browser tabs (optional, with confirmation)
- Start a focus timer (Pomodoro or custom)
- Schedule automatic re-enable of notifications when the block ends
- Reverse all of the above with a single restore command

## Inputs

- The desired focus duration (default: 50 min on, 10 min off)
- Which surfaces to mute (OS, Slack, email, browser) â€” sensible defaults supplied
- Whitelist of allowed interruptions (e.g. on-call pager)

## Workflow

1. **Confirm the window** ("Guard for 50 minutes? y/n").
2. **Capture current state** so it can be restored (DND off / on, Slack status, etc.).
3. **Apply the guard** to each requested surface in order: OS â†’ chat â†’ email â†’ browser.
4. **Start a timer** with a visible countdown.
5. **On timer end** (or `restore` command), reverse every change in reverse order.
6. **Report** what was changed so the user can audit.

## Tools

- macOS: `shortcuts run "Focus Mode"`, `osascript`
- Windows: `Focus Assist` via PowerShell, `FocusSession` WinRT API
- Linux: `dunstctl set-paused`, `gsettings`, `mako`
- Slack: `slack-cli status set`, or direct API call
- Browser: `chrome --profile-directory=...` or a session manager

## Examples

**User:** "Guard for 90 minutes, just work apps."
**Response:** "OK. DND on, Slack paused, email snoozed. Work apps left alone. Timer set
to 90 min. I'll restore everything at 11:42."

**User:** "End my focus session."
**Response:** "Restored. DND off, Slack back, email reloaded 4 new messages."

## Safety

- Never disable emergency or on-call surfaces unless explicitly listed as muted
- Always provide a single-command restore
- Do not change password or authentication state
- Surface a visible indicator (menu bar icon, status message) while guard is active

## Pairs Well With

- `time-blocking` (trigger guard at block start)
- `adhd-task-breakdown` (chunk source)
- `unlazy` (the first minute of a block)
