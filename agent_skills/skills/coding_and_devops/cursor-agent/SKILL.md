# Cursor Agent Automation

## Purpose

Drive the **Cursor CLI agent** (`agent`, formerly `cursor-agent`) from a non-interactive
shell, using tmux so the same session can be inspected, taken over, or detached. The
skill wraps prompt construction, model selection, and result capture in a single
operation that any other skill or tool can call.

## When to Use

- A coding task is best handled by Cursor's agent loop
- A long task should run in a tmux session the user can attach to
- Results should land in a file or be returned to the calling skill

## When NOT to Use

- The user wants Cursor's editor UI, not the CLI
- The task requires a different agent (route to `coding-agent`)
- No API key is set for Cursor

## Capabilities

- Construct a Cursor CLI command from prompt + flags
- Run it inside a named tmux session (`cursor-<ts>`)
- Capture the final output block and write it to a result file
- Stream progress into a log file
- Allow user takeover via `tmux attach -t <name>`
- Apply or reject the proposed diff with `apply` / `discard`

## Inputs

- `prompt` (string or path)
- `model` (e.g. `gpt-5`, `claude-3.7-sonnet`, `composer-1`) â€” default Cursor default
- `cwd` â€” default `$PWD`
- `timeout` â€” default 30 min
- `attach` â€” boolean, default false (run detached)

## Workflow

1. **Validate** that the `agent` (or `cursor-agent`) binary is on PATH.
2. **Build the command** with `--print`, `--model`, `--output text`, and the prompt.
3. **Open a tmux session** named `cursor-<unix-ts>`.
4. **Send the command** to the session; redirect output to `.cursor-logs/<ts>.log`.
5. **Heartbeat every 30 s** with elapsed time and last 5 log lines.
6. **On exit**: extract the final assistant message and write to `.cursor-logs/<ts>.out`.
7. **Report** session name, log path, output path, and diff summary.

## Tools

- `tmux` (required)
- `agent` / `cursor-agent` (required)
- `rg` / `grep` for log scrubbing

## Examples

**User:** "Run Cursor on this prompt."
**Response:** Started tmux session `cursor-1739097600`. Logs at
`.cursor-logs/1739097600.log`. Will report when done. Use
`tmux attach -t cursor-1739097600` to take over.

**User:** "Hand off this refactor."
**Response:** Cursor agent running, model `composer-1`, cwd `/repo`. ETA: <5 min.

## Safety

- Never apply a Cursor-proposed diff to a protected branch
- Redact `.env`, `*.pem`, and `id_rsa` from the working dir before launch
- Cap runs at 30 min; require `--no-cap` to extend
- Surface session name and `attach` command in every status

## Pairs Well With

- `coding-agent` (fallback to other agents)
- `autoreview` (review the Cursor diff)
- `git-workflow` (commit the result)
