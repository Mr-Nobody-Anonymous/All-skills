# Coding Agent

## Purpose

Launch, monitor, and inspect a headless coding agent (Codex CLI, Claude Code, OpenCode,
or Pi) as a managed background process. The skill turns "do this fix in another
process" into a single call with deterministic start, streaming output, and clean
shutdown.

## When to Use

- The user wants a non-interactive coding task run by an AI agent
- A long-running refactor or test run should happen in the background
- A second model should attempt a task in parallel
- The user wants logs, status, or a diff pulled from an agent process

## When NOT to Use

- The task needs human-in-the-loop review per step (use a foreground agent)
- The user has no API key or local credentials for any supported agent
- The action is destructive on a protected branch (require explicit confirmation)

## Capabilities

- Launch a supported coding agent CLI with a prompt, model, and workspace
- Stream stdout/stderr to a log file and optionally back to chat
- Detect idle, finished, and errored states
- Apply or reject the agent's proposed diff
- Restart from the last good checkpoint on failure
- Reuse a running tmux/screen session for manual takeover

## Supported Agents

- **Codex CLI** â€” `codex exec --model <m> --cwd <dir> "..."`
- **Claude Code** â€” `claude --model <m> --print "..."`
- **OpenCode** â€” `opencode run --model <m> "..."`
- **Pi Coding Agent** â€” `pi-agent --model <m> "..."`

## Inputs

- `agent` (one of `codex`, `claude`, `opencode`, `pi`)
- `prompt` (string or path to prompt file)
- `model` (optional, agent default if omitted)
- `cwd` (working directory)
- `timeout` (default 30 min)
- `apply_changes` (boolean, default false â€” always require review)

## Workflow

1. **Validate inputs** â€” agent name, prompt non-empty, cwd exists, API key set.
2. **Start the agent** in a background process, redirecting output to a log.
3. **Heartbeat every 30 s** â€” print elapsed time and last 5 log lines.
4. **On timeout**: terminate the process, summarize progress, leave the diff staged.
5. **On finish**: show a short diff summary; wait for user to `apply` or `discard`.
6. **On error**: capture the failure, suggest a smaller prompt retry.

## Tools

- Process control (`start-process`, `kill`, `wait`)
- Optional: `tmux`/`screen` for session reuse
- Log file in `<cwd>/.agent-logs/<agent>-<ts>.log`

## Examples

**User:** "Have Codex fix the failing test in `tests/test_parser.py`."
**Response:** Codex started in `/repo`, model `gpt-5`. Heartbeat at 30 s. Will
report when idle and stage the patch.

**User:** "Run Claude Code on this prompt in another process."
**Response:** Claude Code started. Logs at `.agent-logs/claude-2026-02-09T10-15.log`.
Use `tail -f` to watch, or wait for the finish summary.

## Safety

- Never auto-apply agent diffs to protected branches
- Always require explicit `apply` or `discard`
- Cap a single run at 30 min by default; require an override to extend
- Redact secrets in any streamed output

## Pairs Well With

- `git-workflow` (commit the result)
- `autoreview` (second model review of the diff)
- `behavior-validator` (run the affected test surface)
